HTML SCSS, just HTML and SCSS. In case you were wondering, no javascript. 
If you have already seen the source code, then yes, it is a compressed file, I do not use a lot of class or id selectors, instead I use a lot of combinators: it is then easier for me to memorize and visualize the DOM structure.
I do not know what exact kind of website it is, food delivery, maybe.
Some of the icons were not loading properly and showing an error in the console if I used a CDN link(or whatever that is called). So I had to download all of them. 
None of the links work; only the night mode toggler does.
It took me almost 50 hours to make the webpage (excluding the fact that I spent numerous hours updating the webpage).


And yeah, that's everything I had to say.
